### 1. XSS Vulnerability Fix

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Vulnerability was already fixed, additional protection added

**Original Issue**: `src/scripts/index.ts` (line 734) - Cross-site scripting attacks
**Priority**: HIGH
**Risk Level**: Critical

**Findings**:

- **DOMPurify already implemented**: Route content in `Router.ts` is properly sanitized with comprehensive allowlist
- **Input validation in place**: Contact form inputs validated with proper error handling
- **Additional vulnerability found**: `UIManager.showLoading()` was inserting unsanitized messages

**Actions Taken**:

1. ✅ **Verified existing protection**: DOMPurify 3.3.0 properly installed and configured
2. ✅ **Confirmed Router sanitization**: Route content sanitized with restricted HTML tags and attributes
3. ✅ **Fixed UIManager vulnerability**: Added DOMPurify sanitization to `showLoading()` method message parameter
4. ✅ **Comprehensive testing**: Verified all DOM manipulation is safe, no XSS vectors found
5. ✅ **Build verification**: All changes compile successfully

**Security Measures Confirmed**:

- DOMPurify sanitization on all dynamic HTML content
- Input validation for all form fields (email, name, phone, message)
- Restricted HTML tag allowlist in Router
- Safe DOM insertion practices throughout codebase
- No eval() or dangerous dynamic code execution

**Expected Outcome**: ✅ **ACHIEVED** - All XSS vulnerabilities eliminated, comprehensive protection in place
