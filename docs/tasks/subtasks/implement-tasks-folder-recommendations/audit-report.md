### Loose Files

- **src/scripts/modules/github-issues/WorktreeManager.ts**: Code file (potentially part of AI reviewer system)

## Key Discrepancies Identified

1. **Categorization Errors** (RESOLVED):
   - `improve-contact-form-accessibility-ux` moved to todo/
   - `ai-powered-github-issues-reviewer-system` moved to ongoing/
   - Subtasks/ integrated into ongoing/ and todo/

2. **Progress Inaccuracies**:
   - Main README claims 6/11 for openai-image-specialist-agent, actual 5/11
   - Overall progress ~13% completed vs. main README's ~25%
   - Total groups: 13 actual vs. 12 claimed

3. **Structural Issues**:
   - Inconsistent README formats (test-email-sending-implementation lacks checkboxes)
   - Empty README in test-gemini-tool-and-favicon/
   - Loose files not integrated into task structure

## Recommendations

1. ✅ Move `improve-contact-form-accessibility-ux` to todo/
2. ✅ Integrate subtasks/ into ongoing/ and todo/
3. ✅ Update main README with accurate counts and progress
4. Standardize all README formats
5. Relocate loose files to appropriate task groups
