priority: P2
depends_on: [frontend-specialist-agent-03]
tags: [workflow, performance, optimization]

objective:

- Design performance optimization workflow using existing PerformanceTracker and analysis tools

deliverables:

- Performance analysis and optimization workflow in frontend-specialist-agent.md
- Web Vitals monitoring and improvement coordination
- Bundle analysis and code splitting recommendations
- Performance bottleneck identification processes

steps:

- Define performance analysis triggers and metrics collection
- Design Web Vitals monitoring workflow integration
- Implement bundle size analysis using existing build tools
- Create code splitting and lazy loading optimization patterns
- Design image optimization workflow coordination
- Establish caching strategy analysis and recommendations
- Define performance regression detection processes
- Create optimization implementation and validation workflows

tests:

- Unit: Performance analysis logic validation
- Integration: Optimization recommendation accuracy testing
- QA: Performance improvement measurement verification

acceptance_criteria:

- Performance workflow accurately identifies bottlenecks
- Optimization recommendations improve Web Vitals scores
- Workflow integrates with existing PerformanceTracker
- Analysis covers all major performance categories

validation:

- Analyze current LOFERSIL performance metrics
- Test optimization recommendations implementation
- Verify performance improvements against benchmarks
- Validate workflow accuracy and reliability
