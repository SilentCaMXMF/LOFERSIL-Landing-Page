priority: P2
depends_on: [frontend-specialist-agent-09]
tags: [workflow, build-optimization, performance]

objective:

- Design build process optimization workflow using existing build.js and analysis tools

deliverables:

- Build optimization workflow in frontend-specialist-agent.md
- Bundle analysis and code splitting coordination
- Asset optimization and compression processes
- Build performance monitoring and improvement

steps:

- Define build analysis triggers and performance metrics
- Design bundle size analysis using existing build tools
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading optimization
- Create asset optimization workflow coordination
- Design build caching and incremental build strategies
- Establish build performance monitoring patterns
- Define optimization recommendation generation
- Create build configuration validation processes

tests:

- Unit: Build optimization logic validation
- Integration: Build process improvement testing
- QA: Build performance and output quality verification

acceptance_criteria:

- Build optimization workflow identifies performance bottlenecks
- Optimization recommendations improve build times and bundle sizes
- Workflow integrates with existing build.js infrastructure
- Analysis covers all major build optimization categories

validation:

- Analyze current build process performance
- Test optimization recommendations implementation
- Verify build time and bundle size improvements
- Validate build output quality and functionality
