steps:

- Read the index.html file to understand the overall page structure
- Identify main sections (hero, products, footer, etc.)
- Locate the "contacto" button in header or footer
- Note any existing navigation or scrolling mechanisms

tests:

- Unit: N/A for analysis task
- Integration/e2e: N/A for analysis task

acceptance_criteria:

- Page structure documented with sections identified
- "Contacto" button location confirmed in header or footer
- Notes include any relevant IDs or classes for linking

validation:

- Manual review of index.html file
- Verify button exists and is accessible

notes:

- Assumptions: Button exists as "contacto" in Portuguese
- Links to relevant docs: index.html structure

analysis:

- Page structure: Single-page application with sections for hero, about, features, products, CTA, and footer
- Main sections: hero (#hero), about (#about), features (#features), products-showcase (#products-showcase), cta (#cta), footer (#main-footer)
- Navigation: Header navbar with links to each section using anchor links (e.g., #hero, #products-showcase)
- "Contacto" button: Located in header navigation as <a href="#main-footer" class="nav-link">Contacto</a>, linking to the footer section
- Footer structure: Contains company info, quick links (including /contact link), and contact info links
- No existing contact form section; footer serves as contact area but no form
- Navigation mechanism: Anchor links, likely with smooth scrolling handled by JavaScript (NavigationManager.ts)
- Relevant IDs/classes: #main-nav for navbar, #main-footer for footer, nav-link class for menu items
