tags: [research, api-integration]

objective:

- Understand OpenAI API requirements for GPT-4.1-nano image editing capabilities

deliverables:

- Documentation of OpenAI API endpoints, authentication methods, and image editing capabilities
- Assessment of compatibility with existing project structure

steps:

- Review OpenAI API documentation for GPT-4.1-nano image editing features
- Identify required API endpoints and parameters for image operations
- Research authentication and API key management requirements
- Check existing image tool integrations in the project for patterns
- Document any prerequisites or dependencies needed

research_findings:

- **GPT-4.1-nano Model**: Text model with fine-tuning capabilities, priced at $0.20/1M input tokens, $0.80/1M output tokens
- **Image Capabilities**: While GPT-4.1-nano is primarily a text model, image editing can be achieved through:
  - Chat Completions API with vision capabilities (if supported)
  - Integration with dedicated GPT-image-1 models for actual image generation/editing
  - Using GPT-4.1-nano to generate editing instructions or analyze images
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/v1/chat/completions` - For text + vision interactions
  - `/v1/images/generations` - For image generation
  - `/v1/images/edits` - For image editing
  - `/v1/images/variations` - For image variations
- **Authentication**: Bearer token with OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- **Existing Patterns**: Project has MCP integration setup with API keys and external service connections
- **Prerequisites**: OpenAI API key, openai npm package, environment configuration

tests:

- Unit: N/A (research task)
- Integration/e2e: N/A (research task)

acceptance_criteria:

- OpenAI API documentation is reviewed and key requirements documented
- Image editing capabilities of GPT-4.1-nano are clearly understood
- Integration approach is outlined for compatibility with existing tools

validation:

- Manual review of research notes and documentation
- Verify understanding by explaining API requirements to team

notes:

- Focus on image editing tools specifically (dalle-e, variations, edits)
- Consider rate limits, costs, and usage restrictions
- Reference: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images
