objective:

- Implement intelligent decision-making capabilities for autonomous workflow selection and optimization

deliverables:

- Decision engine for workflow selection
- Quality assessment and optimization logic
- Adaptive parameter tuning based on results
- Learning system for continuous improvement

steps:

- Implement decision rules for workflow selection based on input characteristics
- Add quality assessment algorithms for image results
- Create parameter optimization system (size, style, quality adjustments)
- Implement learning from successful/failed operations
- Add confidence scoring for decision recommendations
- Create fallback decision trees for edge cases

tests:

- Unit: Test decision logic with various input scenarios
- Integration/e2e: Test intelligent workflow selection and optimization

acceptance_criteria:

- Agent can intelligently select appropriate workflows
- Quality assessment provides accurate evaluations
- Parameter optimization improves results over time
- Learning system adapts to patterns

validation:

- Test decision accuracy with known scenarios
- Verify quality assessment reliability
- Measure optimization improvements
- Validate learning adaptation

notes:

- Use statistical analysis for quality metrics
- Implement A/B testing for optimization
- Include human feedback integration for learning
- Add decision confidence thresholds
