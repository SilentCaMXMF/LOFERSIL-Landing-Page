feature: openai-image-specialist-agent
priority: P1
depends_on: [openai-image-specialist-agent-02]
tags: [implementation, workflow, orchestration]

objective:

- Implement workflow orchestration system for managing complex image processing pipelines

deliverables:

- Workflow definition and execution engine
- Step-by-step processing pipeline
- Workflow state tracking and progress reporting
- Conditional logic for workflow branching

steps:

- Design workflow data structure (steps, conditions, dependencies)
- Implement workflow executor with step management
- Add workflow validation and error handling
- Create progress tracking and reporting system
- Implement conditional execution based on previous step results
- Add workflow persistence for resumable operations

tests:

- Unit: Test workflow execution with various step combinations
- Integration/e2e: Test complete workflow pipelines

acceptance_criteria:

- Workflows can be defined and executed successfully
- Conditional logic works for branching workflows
- Progress tracking provides accurate status updates
- Workflow errors are handled gracefully

validation:

- Execute sample workflows with different paths
- Verify progress reporting accuracy
- Test workflow resumption after interruption

notes:

- Support both linear and branching workflows
- Include timeout handling for long-running steps
- Implement workflow result aggregation
