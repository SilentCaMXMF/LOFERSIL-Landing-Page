tags: [implementation, core, agent]

objective:

- Implement the core agent framework with basic functionality and state management

deliverables:

- Agent core class with initialization and basic lifecycle management
- State management system for tracking agent operations
- Basic communication interfaces
- Configuration management for agent behavior

steps:

- Create main Agent class with constructor and initialization
- Implement state management (idle, processing, error, completed states)
- Add configuration loading and validation
- Create basic message handling system
- Implement agent lifecycle methods (start, stop, pause, resume)
- Add logging and basic monitoring hooks

tests:

- Unit: Test agent initialization and state transitions
- Integration/e2e: Test basic agent lifecycle operations

acceptance_criteria:

- Agent can be initialized with configuration
- State management works correctly
- Basic communication interfaces are functional
- Agent lifecycle methods work as expected

validation:

- Agent can start and stop without errors
- Configuration validation works
- State transitions are logged correctly

notes:

- Use existing error handling patterns from the project
- Implement thread-safe state management
- Include configuration validation with clear error messages
