feature: openai-image-specialist-agent
priority: P1
depends_on: [openai-image-specialist-agent-05]
tags: [error-handling, recovery, resilience]

objective:

- Implement comprehensive error recovery mechanisms for robust agent operation

deliverables:

- Error classification and recovery strategies
- Automatic retry logic with backoff
- Alternative workflow selection on failures
- Recovery state management and persistence

steps:

- Classify different types of errors (API, network, validation, etc.)
- Implement recovery strategies for each error type
- Add exponential backoff retry logic
- Create alternative workflow paths for failed operations
- Implement recovery state persistence
- Add manual intervention triggers for critical failures

tests:

- Unit: Test error classification and recovery logic
- Integration/e2e: Test recovery from various failure scenarios

acceptance_criteria:

- Agent can recover from common failure scenarios
- Retry logic prevents cascade failures
- Alternative workflows provide viable fallbacks
- Recovery state is properly maintained

validation:

- Test recovery from API failures
- Verify retry logic effectiveness
- Confirm alternative workflow selection
- Validate state persistence during recovery

notes:

- Implement circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
- Add recovery time tracking and reporting
- Include graceful degradation options
