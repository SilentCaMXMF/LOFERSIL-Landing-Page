tags: [performance, optimization, caching]

objective:

- Optimize agent performance through caching, parallelization, and resource management

deliverables:

- Caching system for repeated operations
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Resource usage optimization
- Performance monitoring and metrics

steps:

- Implement result caching with TTL and invalidation
- Add parallel workflow execution for independent steps
- Optimize memory usage for large image processing
- Implement connection pooling for API calls
- Add performance metrics collection
- Create optimization recommendations system

tests:

- Unit: Test caching and parallelization logic
- Integration/e2e: Test performance improvements with real workloads

acceptance_criteria:

- Caching reduces redundant API calls
- Parallel processing improves throughput
- Memory usage stays within limits
- Performance metrics are accurate and useful

validation:

- Measure performance improvements with caching
- Test parallel processing scalability
- Verify memory usage optimization
- Confirm metrics accuracy

notes:

- Implement smart cache invalidation strategies
- Add workload balancing for parallel tasks
- Include performance profiling tools
