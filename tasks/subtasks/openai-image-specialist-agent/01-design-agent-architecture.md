# 01. Design agent architecture

meta:

feature: openai-image-specialist-agent
priority: P1
depends_on: []
tags: [architecture, design, planning]

objective:

- Design a comprehensive architecture for an intelligent agent that can autonomously handle image processing workflows using the OpenAI Image Specialist

deliverables:

- Agent architecture diagram and documentation
- Core component specifications
- Data flow and communication patterns
- Decision-making framework outline

steps:

- Analyze existing OpenAI Image Specialist capabilities and limitations
- Define agent goals and use cases (image enhancement, batch processing, quality assessment, etc.)
- Design modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Specify communication interfaces and data formats
- Define agent state management and persistence requirements
- Create decision tree framework for intelligent workflow selection

tests:

- Unit: N/A (design task)
- Integration/e2e: N/A (design task)

acceptance_criteria:

- Architecture design is complete and documented
- All major components and their interactions are specified
- Decision-making framework is outlined
- Scalability and extensibility considerations are addressed

validation:

- Architecture review by team members
- Validation against existing OpenAI Image Specialist API
- Ensure compatibility with current project structure

notes:

- Consider agent autonomy levels (fully autonomous vs semi-supervised)
- Include fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Design for both real-time and batch processing capabilities
- Reference existing agent patterns in the project
