# Task Audit and Consolidation

This directory contains the comprehensive task audit and consolidation plan to align project task management with actual implementation reality.

## Overview

The task audit identifies significant discrepancies between reported task status and actual completion state. Many tasks marked as "in-progress" are actually completed with full implementation, testing, and documentation.

## Files

1. **01-audit-completion-status.md** - Comprehensive audit of current vs actual task status
2. **02-identify-truly-completed-tasks.md** - Tasks actually finished but mislabeled
3. **03-consolidate-overlapping-tasks.md** - Analysis and plan for duplicate/overlapping tasks
4. **04-update-task-statuses.md** - Action plan for status corrections
5. **05-create-consolidated-task-list.md** - Final streamlined task priorities

## Key Findings Summary

- **MCP GitHub SSE Error Diagnosis**: COMPLETED (has COMPLETE.md and full implementation)
- **Test Suite Reorganization**: DONE (all tests moved to proper locations)
- **Weekly Tasks Review Process**: COMPLETED (process implemented and documented)
- **MCP Implementation**: LARGELY COMPLETED (13/14 subtasks done)
- **AI Tools Integration**: PARTIALLY COMPLETED (core components implemented)
- **Test Fixes**: MOSTLY COMPLETED (infrastructure and mocks in place)

This audit provides evidence-based analysis using file contents, test results, and implementation artifacts to establish the true project state.
