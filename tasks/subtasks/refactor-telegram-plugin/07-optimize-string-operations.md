priority: P3
depends_on: [06]
tags: [refactoring, performance]

objective:

- Optimize string processing operations for better performance

deliverables:

- Optimized string handling code
- Performance benchmarks

steps:

- Identify string-heavy operations in the code
- Replace inefficient string concatenation with more efficient methods
- Optimize regex patterns if used
- Implement string pooling where beneficial
- Add performance monitoring

tests:

- Unit: Performance tests for string operations
- Integration: Overall plugin performance improved

acceptance_criteria:

- String operations are optimized for performance
- Memory usage reduced where possible
- No functional changes to string processing
- Performance metrics show improvement

validation:

- Benchmark results show improvement
- Memory profiling indicates better usage

notes:

- Focus on message formatting and parsing
- Consider trade-offs between readability and performance

analysis:

- Current string operations may use inefficient patterns
- Optimization should not compromise code clarity
