Risk assessment

- Low risk: Refactoring existing functionality without changing external APIs
- Medium risk: Potential breaking changes if interfaces are modified
- Mitigation: Comprehensive testing after each step, maintain backward compatibility

Exit criteria

- The refactoring is complete when all modules are modularized, error handling is robust, string operations are optimized, code is type-safe with proper interfaces, message content is sanitized, plugin structure follows best practices, and all existing functionality is preserved with improved performance and maintainability
