tags: [refactoring, architecture]

objective:

- Restructure the plugin into well-organized, modular components

deliverables:

- Modular plugin architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved code organization

steps:

- Analyze current plugin structure
- Create separate files/modules for different responsibilities
- Refactor main plugin class to orchestrate modules
- Update imports and exports
- Ensure proper dependency injection

tests:

- Unit: Each module tested independently
- Integration: Plugin assembles correctly

acceptance_criteria:

- Plugin is split into logical modules
- Main plugin file is clean and focused on orchestration
- Dependencies are clear and manageable
- Code is more maintainable and testable

validation:

- All functionality works after restructuring
- No circular dependencies
- Build process succeeds

notes:

- Follow existing module patterns in the codebase
- Consider plugin lifecycle management

analysis:

- Current structure may be monolithic
- Need to maintain plugin API compatibility
