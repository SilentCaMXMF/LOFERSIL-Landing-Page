tags: [file-operations, reliability]

objective:

- Improve file handling logic to be more robust and handle edge cases

deliverables:

- Enhanced file path resolution and validation
- Better error handling for file operations
- Optimized unique filename generation

steps:

- Add validation for file paths and directories
- Improve getDateBasedPath to handle different environments
- Enhance getUniqueFilename to prevent infinite loops and handle permissions
- Add checks for file existence and write permissions
- Update image saving to handle different formats and sizes

tests:

- Unit: Test file path functions with various inputs
- Integration: Verify file saving in different scenarios

acceptance_criteria:

- File operations are reliable and handle errors gracefully
- Unique filenames are generated without conflicts
- Supports various image formats
- No file system errors in normal operation

validation:

- Test file operations in a safe environment
- Check for permission issues

notes:

- Ensure compatibility with Bun and Node.js environments
- Reference file system best practices
